Tank Date: September 11\, 2025 Time: 5:30 PM - 5:30 PM CDT Website: http://rhinelanderlibrary.org Event Description: Local author David L. Tank will present his newest cozy mystery\, The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge \, at an exclusive book launch. “I’m thrilled to have the launch of this new book at the Rhinelander District Library\,” said Tank. The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge takes place in the Northwoods\, and a key element of the story revolves around an event to raise funds for expansion of a Northwoods public library. “Gee\, I wonder what inspired that idea?” Tank grinned\, referring to the Rhinelander library’s current expansion campaign. Area residents may be familiar with Tank’s area history book Postcards from the Past: Then and Now Pictures of Wisconsin’s Northwoods. “I love connecting my writing to local history\,” said Tank. “I know that readers have fun identifying the actual places that inspired the fictitious settings in my Blackbird Cabin mystery books.” Tank’s cozy mystery series began with The Secret of Blackbird Cabin (2024)\, followed by The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge (2025). Before devoting his time to writing\, photography and publishing\, Tank taught writing and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. He has also worked as a newspaper and magazine editor\, senior writer for a major fraternal organization\, and communications director for several nonprofit organizations. In addition to cozy mysteries\, he has also written a series of middle-grade adventure novels and books featuring 3D photography. Tank will sell and sign books after the program. All of his books will be available for purchase\, and cash and checks are accepted. This event is free and open to the public.
