On the third Tuesday of each month\, the Rhinelander Pop-Up Pantry happens at the National Guard Armory (1136 Adams Way/Military Road) in Rhinelander. Pantry hours are from 4:30 – 6:00 p.m. (or until the food is gone) the third Tuesday of every month.  Please do not come before 3:30 p.m. Ruby's Pantry is set up as a drive through service.  We will bring your shares to you. You receive an abundance of grocery items so please bring along two large boxes and make sure you have adequate room in your vehicle – all for a $ 25 cash donation. All of the food received is donated by retailers and producers – the cash donation helps transport the food on the day of the pantry.  Ruby’s Pantry is a faith-based food distribution – no government funding is received at a local or ministry level. There are NO income requirements – if you eat food\, you qualify! Ruby’s Pantry is for everyone. You are not taking food away from someone else by participating – but you are providing tasty food for you and your family. We are often asked what happens to any left-over food following Ruby’s Pantry – Calvary donates this to the Food Pantry in Rhinelander and a few other non-profit groups in our area.  Nothing is wasted. We are always looking for volunteers. All volunteers are required to fill out a form and have a background check to assist with the food distribution.  All volunteer requests are processed online.  Go to https://www.rubyspantry.org/volunteer-application .  If you have any questions feel free to contact us at 715-362-4792.  We have the best volunteers in the world!

Enter the dragon's lair\, a.k.a. Dragonfly Pond\, on August 20th from 4-5 PM and find out how it gets its name by exploring the shoreline for evidence of its not-so-mythical dragons\, including adults\, larval nymphs\, and shed casings (exuviae). Dragonflies serve as important bioindicators that can clue us in to pollution of aquatic ecosystems\, and dragonfly-seekers of all ages and experience levels have contributed to a wealth of data that helps keep our waters clean. You'll have the chance to take a closer look at the dragonfly life cycle as we practice collecting and identifying nymphs to family\, but come prepared to get your hands dirty since we must sift through pond muck to find them! This event takes place during the Odolympics\, a yearly challenge to record as many dragonfly and damselfly species as possible hosted by the Dragonfly Society of the Americas. Anyone can participate—you will receive information on this event alongside many other Odonata resources and volunteer surveys!
