We will launch from the boat landing of the beautiful, 303-acre Escanaba Lake. Historically a portage route for Native Americans from Lake Superior to the Wisconsin River, Escanaba Lake features meandering shoreline, four islands and plentiful wildlife making Escanaba Lake a paddler’s paradise. We will disembark our watercrafts on shore and hike a portion of the Escanaba Trail where we will have time to have a snack and contemplate the many wonders of nature. Participants are encouraged to use their creativity to write a drabble, an essay of exactly 100 words using a prompt from nature. If time permits, the group can exchange essays while sitting ashore. The group will then hike back to our watercrafts and paddle back to the boat landing to complete our excursion.</p>\n<p><strong>Attendees must supply their own watercrafts. Please meet at Escanaba Lake Bo",

During our travels, we will visit several early sites, including ranger stations, watch towers, Civilian Conservation Corps camps, state nurseries, a ranger cabin, forest fires, Youth Conservation Corps camps and more. Some historic logging sites will be viewed as well. Importantly, we will also explore modern forest practices that illustrate the long-term commitment to sustainable forests in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants need to bring a lunch, water and shoes suitable for short hikes on uneven ground.

Volunteer Opportunities Visit Author Talk with David L. Tank Share: Name: Author Talk with David L. Tank Date: September 11, 2025 Time: 5:30 PM - 5:30 PM CDT Website: http://rhinelanderlibrary.org Event Description: Local author David L. Tank will present his newest cozy mystery, The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge , at an exclusive book launch. “I’m thrilled to have the launch of this new book at the Rhinelander District Library,” said Tank. The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge takes place in the Northwoods, and a key element of the story revolves around an event to raise funds for expansion of a Northwoods public library. “Gee, I wonder what inspired that idea?” Tank grinned, referring to the Rhinelander library’s current expansion campaign. Area residents may be familiar with Tank’s area history book Postcards from the Past: Then and Now Pictures of Wisconsin’s Northwoods. “I love connecting my writing to local history,” said Tank. “I know that readers have fun identifying the actual places that inspired the fictitious settings in my Blackbird Cabin mystery books.” Tank’s cozy mystery series began with The Secret of Blackbird Cabin (2024), followed by The Secrets of Foxglove Lodge (2025). Before devoting his time to writing, photography and publishing, Tank taught writing and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. He has also worked as a newspaper and magazine editor, senior writer for a major fraternal organization, and communications director for several nonprofit organizations. In addition to cozy mysteries, he has also written a series of middle-grade adventure novels and books featuring 3D photography. Tank will sell and sign books after the program. All of his books will be available for purchase, and cash and checks are accepted. This event is free and open to the public.

On the third Tuesday of each month, the Rhinelander Pop-Up Pantry happens at the National Guard Armory (1136 Adams Way/Military Road) in Rhinelander. Pantry hours are from 4:30 – 6:00 p.m. (or until the food is gone) the third Tuesday of every month.  Please do not come before 3:30 p.m. Ruby's Pantry is set up as a drive through service.  We will bring your shares to you. You receive an abundance of grocery items so please bring along two large boxes and make sure you have adequate room in your vehicle – all for a $ 25 cash donation. All of the food received is donated by retailers and producers – the cash donation helps transport the food on the day of the pantry.  Ruby’s Pantry is a faith-based food distribution – no government funding is received at a local or ministry level. There are NO income requirements – if you eat food, you qualify! Ruby’s Pantry is for everyone. You are not taking food away from someone else by participating – but you are providing tasty food for you and your family. We are often asked what happens to any left-over food following Ruby’s Pantry – Calvary donates this to the Food Pantry in Rhinelander and a few other non-profit groups in our area.  Nothing is wasted. We are always looking for volunteers. All volunteers are required to fill out a form and have a background check to assist with the food distribution.  All volunteer requests are processed online.  Go to https://www.rubyspantry.org/volunteer-application .  If you have any questions feel free to contact us at 715-362-4792.  We have the best volunteers in the world!
