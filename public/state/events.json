By the late 19th century, Wisconsin’s leaders wished to create a state park or forest reserve in Iron, Vilas, Oneida and Forest counties to serve generations of residents and visitors. During our travels, we will visit several early sites, including ranger stations, watch towers, Civilian Conservation Corps camps, state nurseries, a ranger cabin, forest fires, Youth Conservation Corps camps and more. Some historic logging sites will be viewed as well. Importantly, we will also explore modern forest practices that illustrate the long-term commitment to sustainable forests in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants need to bring a lunch, water and shoes suitable for short hikes on uneven ground. Some paths may have fallen logs to step over. Hiking will be moderate to light.  Registered p",

All of the food received is donated by retailers and producers – the cash donation helps transport the food on the day of the pantry.  Ruby’s Pantry is a faith-based food distribution – no government funding is received at a local or ministry level. There are NO income requirements – if you eat food, you qualify! Ruby’s Pantry is for everyone. You are not taking food away from someone else by participating – but you are providing tasty food for you and your family. We are often asked what happens to any left-over food following Ruby’s Pantry – Calvary donates this to the Food Pantry in Rhinelander and a few other non-profit groups in our area.  Nothing is wasted. We are always looking for volunteers. All volunteers are required to fill out a form and have a background check to assist with the food distribution.  All volunteer requests are processed online.  Go to https://www.rubyspantry.org/volunteer-application .  If you have any questions feel free to contact us at 715-362-4792.  We have the best volunteers in the world!

Enter the dragon's lair, a.k.a. Dragonfly Pond, on August 20th from 4-5 PM and find out how it gets its name by exploring the shoreline for evidence of its not-so-mythical dragons, including adults, larval nymphs, and shed casings (exuviae). Dragonflies serve as important bioindicators that can clue us in to pollution of aquatic ecosystems, and dragonfly-seekers of all ages and experience levels have contributed to a wealth of data that helps keep our waters clean. You'll have the chance to take a closer look at the dragonfly life cycle as we practice collecting and identifying nymphs to family, but come prepared to get your hands dirty since we must sift through pond muck to find them! This event takes place during the Odolympics, a yearly challenge to record as many dragonfly and damselfly species as possible hosted by the Dragonfly Society of the Americas. Anyone can participate—you will receive information on this event alongside many other Odonata resources and volunteer surveys!
